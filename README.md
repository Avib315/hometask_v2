**Overview**
This project was initially created by a junior developer, and it’s a bit messy. Your task is to clean it up and make it more robust. The form is the main component here, and it needs some serious attention.

**Task Requirements**
API Integration:

Implement API calls to a government API using React Query. This is a requirement for the task.
Form Handling & Validation:

Ensure that the form fields are validated, with appropriate error messages on submission.
The submit button should only be enabled when all fields are valid.
The R&D department is confident there's a popular and well-supported library that can help streamline handling forms and inputs. Leveraging such a library could make your job easier and improve the final result.
State Management:

The form’s state should persist even after a page refresh. Currently, this isn’t handled well.
Styling:

Keep the existing layout and styling. This isn't the focus of the task.

**Code Enhancement:**
You have the freedom to improve the overall code structure. Better file organization, more efficient functions, or any other enhancements you see fit are encouraged.

*Final Notes*
Feel free to use your skills and judgment to make the project as clean and maintainable as possible. We're looking forward to seeing how you can elevate this project!
