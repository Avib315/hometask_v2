# Frontend Developer Task - Simple Form Enhancement

## Overview

This project was initially created by a junior developer, and it’s a bit messy. Your task is to clean it up and make it maintainable and reusable. The form is the main component here, and it needs some serious attention.

## Setup

To get started with the project, please fork the repository to your GitHub account.

## Task Requirements

### 1. API Integration
- Implement API calls to a government API using **React Query**. This is a requirement for the task.

### 2. Form Handling & Validation
- Ensure that the form fields are validated, with appropriate error messages on submission.
- The submit button should only be enabled when all fields are valid.
- The R&D department is confident there's a popular and well-supported library that can help streamline handling forms and inputs. Leveraging such a library could make your job easier and improve the final result.

### 3. State Management
- The form’s state should persist even after a page refresh. Currently, this isn’t handled well.

### 4. Styling
- Keep the existing layout and styling. This isn't the focus of the task.

### 5. Code Enhancement
- You have the freedom to improve the overall code structure. Better file organization, more efficient functions, or any other enhancements you see fit are encouraged.

## Final Notes

Feel free to use your skills and judgment to make the project as clean and maintainable as possible. We're looking forward to seeing how you can elevate this project!
